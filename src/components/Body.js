          of a huge bank robbery. A critic wrote that "Allu Arjun puts in a 
          confident performance as the loveable rogue. It's a role that is 
          right up his alley and he carries it off with a characteristic 
          panache. He lights up the screen with his dancing in particular, 
          pulling off some pretty challenging dance moves."Riya Chakravarty 
          of NDTV, in her review, stated that "Arjun has delivered an 
          outstanding performance." He was nominated for the SIIMA Award 
          for Best Actor (Telugu), for his performance in the film.
